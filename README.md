# A basic navigation bar for a website

This just a practice project bootstrapped with [Create React App] using a free UI template from the online figma community(https://www.figma.com/file/1ayT06tgbj8S4RFqRkSFQn/NavBar-(Community)?type=design&t=i6jIfamcNJYsCBo8-6). Any feedback for this final product implementation is very welcome.

## For the community

This project is entirely open to anyone who is interested in making it better or even improving it in one way or the other.
